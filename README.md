Card matching game

In this game the user is supposed to click one card and then match it with another card if the second card doesn't match the first then both cards flip back over and you have to restart.


How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

We made a condition that determined if the first card turned over was equal to the second card then they would stay flipped over. If the cards did not match, the class would be removed and the card would turn back over. We also added a function that determined if all the cards are flipped over at the same time and matched then the game is over.

Optimizations: Due to time constraints, the styling wasnt the best so need to work on styling more.

Lessons learned: Will add more when changes are made.
